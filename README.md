Assignment : build website from scratch to match template 
This is an assignment in the Foundations Course section of Odin Project.
The project requires me to build a website from scratch only using a mock template as a guide. At this point I am about 2-3 months into learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. Although this assignment doesnt include Javascript practice. I have created about 3 or 4 other websites by following tutorials on youtube and coding along. This project is a great test of all the knowledge ive gained so far. I will first try to code solely off memory and research. Then i will compare and look at other odin project students code as well as the code of the few websites ive built.
